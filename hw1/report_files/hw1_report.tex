	\section{Problem Statement}
	The goal of this assignment is to develop a sequential program that simulates Conway's \textit{Game of Life}, which will later be compared to a parallelized version also developed as part of the parallel and concurrent programming course at Rowan University. The program must accept a single input specifying the grid size, M (where the grid is M by M), along with another input for the maximum number of iterations the game is allowed to run. The program's execution time will be evaluated based on a set of test cases provided by the course instructor, Dr. Guo. The program is to be written in C and executed on Rowan University's cluster computer.
